### Prerequisities

1.  A native MacOS (preferred Mojave) system with Xcode 10. This course will based on Swift 4.2 and it is [supported](https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads) with Xcode 10. If you have a Hackintosh running Xcode 10 you are also welcomed (Hackintosh related problems are under your responsibility). :smiley:
2. Basic knowledge about any programming language.

### Goal

The aim of this study group is to learn the fundamentals of Swift programming language, XCode environment, creating iOS applications, integrating API's and CocoaPods and finally tracking the creation progress using GitHub version control system. By the end of this course, students will have the fundamental knowledge to develop desired iOS applications and a general opinion where to go next.
